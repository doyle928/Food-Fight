  <p></i>Thank you for playing Food Fight For Good.
    Most times hunger is caused by poverty and injustice.
  Many families suffering from hunger and poverty live in areas
  where fresh, unprocessed, healthy food is not available or is expensive,
  while the food they do have access to is nutritionally deficient.
As the food rescue and food bank program serving Washtenaw County,
Food Gatherers exists to alleviate hunger and eliminate its causes in our community.</p>
